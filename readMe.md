## Introduction

This repository contains Shazwan's answer for the Parallel Processing Lab. The lab focuses on parallelism using MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP. The code is written in C and aims to provide a learning experience in parallel processing.

## Context

Parallel processing is a fascinating subject that explores the concept of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. In this lab, we utilize the power of MPI and OpenMP to harness parallelism effectively. By utilizing these technologies, we can achieve improved performance and efficiency in our computational tasks.
